it's my second game and first platformer
***
i spent a lot of time and effort on its development, but sometimes errors and warnings still come out, which I can't do anything about. i fixed what i could, the rest will stay the same. this project is purely for gaining my experience, it does not pretend to be anything else.

to play the game you need to download all the files downloaded to the folder 'PLAY' and run
